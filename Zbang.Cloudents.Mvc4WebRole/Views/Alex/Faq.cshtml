Using feedback from our dedicated users, we re-vamped and re-designed Spitball from the ground up. Don't worry though - all the documents from the old Spitball are still available! Just search for your class under "Class Material." Then click on "Source" and "Spitball.co" to filter only Spitball results. And don't forget to like the documents you want to keep handy!</span></div>
