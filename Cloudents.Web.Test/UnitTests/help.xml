				We here at Spitball like to make you guys happy, and we recognized that our last website was just not cutting it! Using feedback from our dedicated users, we revamped and re-designed Spitball from the ground up. Don't worry though - all the documents from the old Spitball are still available! Just search for your class under "Study Documents" Then click on "Source" and "Spitball.co" to filter only Spitball results.
