/** TalkJS Default Theme **/
/*
This is a TalkJS theme file. Themes are designed to allow you to easily change
the main look and feel of TalkJS. Themes cannot be used to change the layout,
e.g. you cannot change which panels appear where.

If you understand CSS, you will feel right at home with TalkJS theme files.
A theme looks like a CSS file, except that the available classes and
properties are limited to what you see here. If you remove a property, the theme
will fail to work and TalkJS will revert to the default theme. If you add a
property, it will be ignored.

The easiest way to make a theme is to start with a default theme (this file)
and edit it until you're happy with the results.

PLEASE NOTE: We continuously add options and features to TalkJS themes (in a
backward compatible way). If you need to theme something that you can't access,
let us know! We may be able to add it quickly.
